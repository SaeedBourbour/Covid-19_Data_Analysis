### Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected countries around the world, but the breadth and severity have varied greatly. Using data from the World Happiness Report, this study will assess the maximum daily infection rates in various nations and their relationship with socioeconomic parameters such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom to make life choices. Our goal with this study is to discover potential patterns and linkages that can aid in understanding the virus's propagation and developing effective
response methods.
COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has posed significant global problems since its outbreak in late 2019. Understanding the mechanisms influencing COVID-19's distribution and severity is critical for public health planning and policymaking. This study uses infection rate data and socioeconomic characteristics to investigate potential relationships that could explain disparities in infection rates among countries.

### Data Source

COVID-19 Infection. Data: The dataset comprising confirmed COVID-19 instances was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/code/aburda/covid-19-analysis-using-python. World Happiness Report Data: Socioeconomic data were collected from the World Happiness Report, with a focus on GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom to make life decisions.

### Result & Conclusion

The maximum daily infection rates were calculated for each country. Notably, China, Italy, and Spain experienced some of the highest rates at different times during the pandemic. The analysis indicates that socio-economic factors such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom to make life choices have varying degrees of correlation with COVID-19 infection rates. Wealthier nations did not uniformly experience lower infection rates, suggesting that factors like population density, government response, and healthcare infrastructure play crucial roles. Understanding the interplay between socioeconomic factors and COVID-19 infection rates is vital for effective pandemic management. This study provides insights that can aid policymakers in tailoring interventions based on specific socio-economic contexts, potentially improving outcomes in future public health crises.
